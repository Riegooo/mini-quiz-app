# 🧠 Mini Quiz App

A simple **console-based quiz application** built using **Node.js**.  
Users can answer multiple-choice questions directly in the terminal.  

This project was created as part of my **JavaScript learning challenge and exercise**,  
aimed at improving my understanding of core JavaScript concepts.

It’s a fun and educational project to practice problem-solving and logic building using pure JavaScript!
